## Project Overview

### Functionality

The SonoGlow RGB LED Display is a system designed to accompany music playback with synchronized visual output. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi and a custom Python application, the LED matrix panel displays visual patterns and album artwork in real time, enhancing the music listening experience with visual feedback.

Key components and features include:

- **Album Art Display**: Album artwork is retrieved from Spotify's API and displayed on the LED panel, providing a visual association with the currently playing track.
- **Spotify Integration**: Through the Spotify API, the system communicates with the music service to ensure that visual changes correspond with the playback seamlessly.

### Purpose

The SonoGlow project was undertaken to explore the intersection of auditory and visual media in real-time. It serves as a practical application combining software development with digital electronics to enhance the experience of music listening through visual stimuli.

As an individual effort, the project provided a platform to apply concepts from hardware control, software development, and API utilization, encompassing comprehensive skills in both computing and creative design.
